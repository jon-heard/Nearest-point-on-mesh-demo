- ui: mesh load dialog
- ui: name of mesh in status bar

- fix ignoring backface on projected texture (shouldn't draw if inside!)

- Clean up code!
    - add "Scene" and "Scene_Demo" class.  Put all non-rendering details in "Scene" and "Scene_Demo".  Leave rendering details in "Main3DScene"
    - rename "Main3DScene" to "SceneRenderer"
    - use 'this->' whenever applicable
    - use accessors whenever possible
    - look for places to use 'unsigned'
    - consistant comments: start uppercase vs lowercase
    - consistant indentation
    - have mainwindow get more involved with setting main3dscene stuff
        - or make separate scene class for holding scene stuff, and main3dscene just uses that

- writeup
- get this working on my laptop

- rotations: fix (quaternions)

- confirm: ignoring backfacing (with point too)

- get distancedTexture shader working
- get old school decal styles working

- use bsp or octree to optimize search
