- add dropdown selector for decal state
- add multiple shaders for mesh (for decals)

- have mainwindow get more involved with setting main3dscene stuff
    - or make separate scene class for holding scene stuff, and main3dscene just uses that


- rotations: fix (quaternions)

- nearest point: algorithm to work between vertices.  Test with low poly box
    - confirm: ignoring backfacing

- get other decal working

- use bsp or octree to optimize search

- ui: mesh load dialog
- ui: name of mesh in status bar

- Clean up code!

- Polish: x/y/z axis-rose thingy in local 3d space
